Creating an energy-efficient optimizer for smart homes involves gathering energy usage data, analyzing it to identify patterns and inefficiencies, and then providing recommendations. Below is a simplified Python program that outlines how you might approach this. This example assumes you have access to energy usage data, which could be collected from smart meters or other sensors in the home.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data loading function
def load_energy_data(file_path):
    """
    Loads energy usage data from a CSV file.
    
    :param file_path: Path to the CSV file containing energy data.
    :return: DataFrame with energy data.
    """
    try:
        data = pd.read_csv(file_path, parse_dates=['timestamp'])
        return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File not found at {file_path}")
    except pd.errors.ParserError:
        print("Error: Failed to parse CSV. Please check the file format.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

# Sample function to analyze usage patterns
def analyze_usage_patterns(data):
    """
    Analyzes energy usage patterns to identify high consumption periods and anomalies.
    
    :param data: DataFrame with energy usage data.
    :return: A report dictionary containing insights.
    """
    try:
        data['hour'] = data['timestamp'].dt.hour
        hourly_usage = data.groupby('hour')['usage'].mean()
        
        high_usage_hours = hourly_usage[hourly_usage > hourly_usage.mean() + hourly_usage.std()]
        anomalies = data[data['usage'] > data['usage'].mean() + 2*data['usage'].std()]
        
        report = {
            'average_hourly_usage': hourly_usage,
            'high_usage_hours': high_usage_hours.index.tolist(),
            'anomalies': anomalies
        }
        return report
    except KeyError as e:
        print(f"Error: Missing expected data column - {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error during analysis: {e}")

# Sample function to generate actionable insights
def generate_insights(report):
    """
    Generates actionable insights based on the usage report.
    
    :param report: Dictionary with analysis report.
    :return: List of insights or recommendations.
    """
    try:
        insights = []
        
        if 'high_usage_hours' in report:
            insights.append(f"Consider adjusting activities or appliances usage during these high usage hours: {report['high_usage_hours']}")
        
        if not report['anomalies'].empty:
            insights.append("There are anomalies in energy usage that might need investigation, such as potential faulty appliances.")
        
        return insights
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in generating insights: {e}")
        return []

# Main function
def main():
    # Assume this file is in the current directory
    file_path = 'energy_usage_data.csv'
    
    # Load energy data
    data = load_energy_data(file_path)
    
    if data is not None:
        # Analyze the data for usage patterns
        report = analyze_usage_patterns(data)
        
        if report:
            # Generate insights
            insights = generate_insights(report)
            print("\nActionable Insights:")
            for insight in insights:
                print("- " + insight)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation:

- **`load_energy_data`**: Loads data from a CSV file, converting timestamp strings into datetime objects. Includes error handling for missing or incorrectly formatted files.
  
- **`analyze_usage_patterns`**: Analyzes the data to find the average usage per hour and identifies high usage periods and potential anomalies. Includes error handling for possible issues, such as missing columns.

- **`generate_insights`**: Generates practical advice based on the analysis report. Offers suggestions like adjusting usage timings and investigating anomalies. Includes error handling to ensure meaningful output even if not all parts of the report are generated successfully.

- **`main`**: Coordinates the loading of data, analysis, and generation of insights, providing a simple command-line interface to the tool.

This example uses mock data and processes. In a real-world application, you would replace the sample data loading and processing logic with methods to load, store, and process data from your actual data sources (e.g., smart meters). Additionally, you might add more sophisticated analytics to generate deeper insights.
